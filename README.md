</div>

In the drilling of oil wells, equipment consisting of a sequence of pipes and a drill at its end is used. This set, with the application of rotation and weight on the entire structure, called a drill string, fragments the rock at the bottom of the wells. These concepts are depicted in the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alison-silva-217212135_activity-6858874651595153408-szUA/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drilling Rig</a> animation made by Pertroanimes in greater detail.

Sensors are coupled to the various drilling equipment for monitoring, however, such devices are susceptible to failures, which leads to a lack of data.

A machine learning model will be used to correct the missing data generated due to the deficiency of the weight on the bit (WOB) sensor.

As a condition for the algorithm to submit the data into the model, that will return the value projection, it is necessary that WOB is null and the other variables are not. Therefore, the result is displayed in graphs with the replacement of the weight on the bit along with the rotation (RPM) and the depth of the well (DEPTH), in order to analyze if the result is suitable.
